                    Queerness has always had coded aesthetics. In the ‘70s, gay men walked around with differennet coloured bandanas in their back pockets to represent a particular sexual position or fetish. 
                    Today, we have lesbian haircuts and bisexual bobs. Historically, queer lives have been lived in secrecy, in innuedos, maybe a glance or a touch here and there. As Jose Esteban Muñoz, 
                    a seminal queer theorist, said, “Qqueerness is often transmitted covertly.” Queer and trans folx have developed signals out of necessity— j. Just as physical spaces had to be created 
                    for the community for community to gather, aesthetic choices into do with hair, fashion and , jewellery have also developed for more subtle acknowledgements of one another.

                    But these signals are not universal, nor are they necessarily shared between subsets of the communityintergenerational for every family. SWhat is queer to you and me, may not be to your parents and so,
                    queer students must navigate through the murky waters of covertness and overtness:. How much is too much? How much is enough?

                    Certain aeshtetics—  like the bleach blond look for gay men—  have become running and well-recognized themes; in the queer community. eEven straight men have jumped on the bandwagon. 
                    That said, the visibility of a clearly-coded aesthetic can help people who are new to the community or those unsure of their place in it find a way in.

                    But what makes a certain hairstyle queer? What is it about bleached hair or undercuts that just screams gay? Perhaps, it’s the word queer itself. Queer ways of being have always subverted the norm. 
                    If normal is black or brown or blonde hair, then on a rudimentaryrudimentarly level, queer is blue or green or pink.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While these are more easily recognisable choices in certain contexts, queerness by nature takes on fluid forms. As the following stories illustrate, the pull and push between queer choices and hair 
                    choices is one of creative tension— - it is both  exploratory and productive.

                    After graduating from a conservative high school with written rules restricting students’ hairstyles, Rory Tsapayi was finally able to grow out his hair and get little twist downs. 
                    But it wasn’t until his freshman winter quarter of his first year when he decided to take the plunge and join the legions of gay men with bleached- blond hair. 
                    Tsapayi originally set out to dye a patch of his hair blond and put it into cornrows.  A few glasses of wine later, he decided to just bleach it all.

                <p>
                    “I really loved it at the time. I was really happy about it,” Tsapayi says. “I feel like that one was more along the lines of, when the gays get a little manic and depressed, they bleach their hair. 
                    In reflection, I hate looking at photos of that time.”
