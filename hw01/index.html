          <h1>Yasna Vismale</h1>
          <h2>Artist. Activist. Entrepreneur. Networking Queen.</h2>
            <p>As a rising sophomore at Columbia University, I am a columnist at the Spectator Newspaper, 
            I completed a fellowship focused on intercultural aspects of Nairobi, Kenya and  
            interned at GGV Capital (a Venture Capital Firm) and Nikko Asset Management.</p>
            <p>Right now I serve as the Alumni Affairs Representative at Columbia Northwestern - 
            connecting students with the alumni base, all while refining my networking skills enough to befriend a few CEOs along the way.</p>
            <p>While not attending University I've had the opportunity to tour throughout Japan and Europe for jazz trumpet/vocals
              and I am also a model signed to Heffner Management.</p>

            <p>Women&&Tech was launched in 2012 to feature interviews with different women working in the tech industry. I became familiar with them when I was invited to be one of the interviewees! A few years later, I joined the team and helped with the relaunch of the site as the front-end architect.</p>

            <p>After coming back from teaching a JavaScript workshop, I felt inspired to create something just for fun. I realized that of all the content/lorem ipsum generators available, there was nothing for HBOâ€™s The Wire fans. I searched for <a href="http://thewireipsum.com" target="_blank">thewireipsum.com</a> domain and it was available! Generate some content for your projects today.</p>
